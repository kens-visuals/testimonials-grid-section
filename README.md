## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the fastest project that I've done on Frontend Mentor. It took me literally 2 hours to finish the whole thing with animations, and responsiveness. However, I understand that this is the result of daily practice and nothing makes me happier than seeing these results.
